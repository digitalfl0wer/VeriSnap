# How to Read a Receipt Page

Receipt pages exist to answer two questions:

1) What exactly was captured?
2) Can I verify it against on-chain truth?

## Sections you’ll see

### Canonical JSON

The normalized snapshot. It should be consistent across runs unless something changed.

### Canonical Hash

A fingerprint of the canonical JSON.
If the JSON changes, the hash changes.

### Verification

VeriSnap verifies by reading from Base RPC and confirming the snapshot matches expected on-chain data.

### Diff History

If multiple snapshots exist, VeriSnap shows what changed over time.
This is the “audit trail.”

### Explorer links (Blockscout/BaseScan)

Used to independently check:

- the transaction
- contract address
- related events/logs

## Common interpretation patterns

- “Hash is the same across days” → your snapshot is stable
- “Diff shows metadata change” → something about the contract or references changed
- “Unverified” → RPC trouble or missing/unsupported source data
