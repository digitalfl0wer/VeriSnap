# Watch Mode (Alerts)

Watch Mode monitors a project and alerts you when VeriSnap detects changes.

## What it’s good for

- launch integrity monitoring
- catching upgrades/proxy changes
- detecting metadata/supply/ownership movement (depending on what your receipt includes)

## How to subscribe

1) Go to a project page (`/p/[slug]`)
2) Click **Watch**
3) Enter your email
4) Confirm subscription (if required by your flow)

## How it works

- A cron job polls the project
- VeriSnap generates a fresh canonical snapshot
- If the snapshot hash differs, a diff is recorded
- If you’re subscribed, you get an alert email

## What you’ll receive

- the project link
- what changed (diff summary)
- timestamp of the run
