# Publish and Share

Publishing stores your receipt snapshot + metadata and creates a shareable page.

## Publish steps

1) Generate a draft
2) (Optional) Claim your publisher
3) Click **Publish**

## What gets published

- the canonical JSON snapshot
- the canonical hash
- project metadata (slug, tx hash/address reference)
- diff history as new snapshots are added over time

## Share your receipt

After publishing you’ll get a link:

- **Project page** (`/p/[slug]`) for history + diffs
- Or **Tx receipt page** (`/receipt/[txHash]`) for the tx-scoped view

Use the link in:

- launch threads
- grant submissions
- hackathon proof
- partner verification
