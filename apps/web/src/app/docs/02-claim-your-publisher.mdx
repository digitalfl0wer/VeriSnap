# Claim your publisher

Publishing is gated by a wallet signature so that published receipts can be tied to a specific publisher identity (typically the party controlling the wallet used in the claim flow).

## How the claim flow works (high level)

- The server creates a short-lived claim token and a human-readable message
- Your wallet signs the message using `personal_sign`
- The signature is sent back to the server with the token
- If verification succeeds, the publish is accepted

This is designed to prevent anonymous edits to published receipts.

## What you sign

The message is intentionally readable. Before you sign:

- Confirm the project slug matches what you expect
- Confirm the version being published matches the draft you reviewed
- Never sign messages you don’t understand

## Common reasons a claim fails

- Wallet not connected or wrong account selected
- User rejected the signature request
- Signature format mismatch (some wallets swap param order; the app retries)
- Claim token expired (refresh and try again)
