# Troubleshooting

## “Draft failed” or “RPC error”

This usually means:

- your RPC endpoint is down or rate-limited
- the tx hash is not on the selected network (Sepolia vs mainnet)
- the contract/address is invalid

Fixes:

- confirm you’re using the right chain (Base Sepolia vs Base mainnet)
- retry in a minute (RPC hiccups happen)
- try the tx hash instead of address (more reliable)

## “Verification failed”

Possible causes:

- RPC read mismatch (temporary)
- contract is a proxy and needs deeper resolution
- explorer enrichment unavailable

Fixes:

- refresh and retry
- check the explorer link (Blockscout/BaseScan) to confirm the tx details
- if it’s a proxy, ensure proxy detection/enrichment is enabled

## “I claimed but it still shows unclaimed”

Possible causes:

- wallet signature not completed
- claim token expired
- you switched wallets

Fixes:

- re-claim using the same wallet used to publish
- then publish again (or re-run publish step if supported)

## “I’m not receiving watch emails”

Possible causes:

- email provider not configured
- message landed in spam
- watcher not saved or cron not running

Fixes:

- check spam/promotions tab
- verify Watch Mode shows you as subscribed
- confirm cron is active (if self-hosted)
