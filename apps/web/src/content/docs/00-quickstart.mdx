# VeriSnap Quickstart (2 minutes)

VeriSnap helps you create a **canonical receipt** for a Base launch, verify it using Base RPC, and publish a shareable history page with diffs.

## What you need

- A **Base** transaction hash (best), or a contract address
- (Optional) A wallet if you want your publish to show as **Claimed**

## Fast path

1) Open VeriSnap
2) Paste a **Tx Hash** (recommended) or **Contract Address**
3) Click **Generate Draft**
4) Review the canonical JSON + hash
5) (Optional) **Connect Wallet → Claim Publisher**
6) Click **Publish**
7) Copy your share link (project page)
8) Turn on **Watch Mode** if you want alerts for future changes

## What you get

- A stable canonical JSON snapshot (“LaunchReceipt”)
- A canonical hash (fingerprint)
- A receipt page with:
  - verification status
  - diff history
  - explorer links (Blockscout/BaseScan)
