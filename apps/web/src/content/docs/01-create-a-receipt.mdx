# Create a Receipt (Draft)

## Option A: Use a Tx Hash (recommended)

1) Copy the Base tx hash from your deploy/launch transaction
2) Paste it into the **Tx Hash** form
3) Click **Generate Draft**

Why this is best:

- A tx receipt is a strong on-chain anchor (logs + metadata)
- Fewer ambiguous guesses than a bare contract address

## Option B: Use a Contract Address

1) Paste the contract address into the **Address** form
2) Click **Generate Draft**

Use this when:

- you don’t have the tx hash handy
- you want to snapshot a contract state post-launch

## What you’ll see in the draft

- **Canonical JSON**: normalized, consistent structure
- **Canonical Hash**: the fingerprint of that JSON
- **RPC verification**: confirmation that the data matches Base RPC reads
